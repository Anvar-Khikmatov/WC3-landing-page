# Warcraft 3 Landing Page Recreation

This project is a recreation of the Warcraft 3 landing page for educational purposes. It was developed as part of a The Odin Project https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page#project-solution homework assignment requiring the creation of a basic landing page. I chose to recreate the Warcraft 3 landing page to make the project more interesting and challenging while learning modern web development techniques.

## Project Details
- **Objective**: Build responsive landing page that demonstrates proficiency in HTML and CSS.
- **Theme**: Inspired by the original Warcraft 3 landing page.
- **Purpose**: Educational use only. This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Blizzard Entertainment.
